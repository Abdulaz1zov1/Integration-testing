## Introduction

An up-to-date 2023 example of how you can use Mocha and Chai to perform API testing for a Node-ExpressJS-Mongoose app. You will be able to test your code locally and also automatically using Github Action. 


## Background info

### What is [Mongoose](https://mongoosejs.com/)

MongooseJS provides a straight-forward solution to modeling your NodeJS application data easily in MongoDB. It handles all MongoDB validation, casting and business logic on your behalf.

### What is [Mocha](https://mochajs.org/)

Mocha is a feature-rich JavaScript test framework running on Node.js and in the browser. It is the test environment of choice for this project.

### What is [Chai](https://www.chaijs.com/)

Chai is an assertion library for Node. Chai assertions and `chai-http` are used in Mocha to perform HTTP testing of the NodeJS API endpoints.
